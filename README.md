##Abstract

Life history theory has focused on the life cycle tradeoffs faced by individuals who
are constrained by 
the energy they can forage for themselves at each age. However, humans are deeply social and adults 
transfer food to children for many years, freeing them from this energy constraint but also bringing the 
risk that parental death could 
entail the death of all dependent offspring. Multiple simultaneously 
dependent offspring also bring a family life cycle squeeze in which dependency ratio doubles. Food 
sharing and alloparenting ameliorate both problems, providing life insurance and smoothi
ng the life 
cycle squeeze, while permitting humans to rely on food resources that would be too uncertain for 
isolated individuals. Food sharing and intergenerational transfers in turn affect the way natural selection 
shapes life histories. We use microsimu
lations to study evolution of life histories. Births inherit the 
motherâ€™s genome subject to mutations. Individuals live under different social arrangements and forage 
with productivity depending on population density. Natural selection on life histories oc
curs. We 
examine the way the size and relatedness of sharing group arrangements alter the evolution of life 
history traits through mutation and natural selection. We consider which social arrangements, with their 
corresponding evolved life histories, are m
ost successful in a group competition where all face the same 
density constraint. There is a tradeoff between costs and benefits of sharing. We find that intermediate 
levels are most successful, unless childhood conditions strongly influence later life pro
ductivity.
