!! Description and labeling of graphs generated by analysis scripts

The purpose is to provide a complete and accurate description (and
caveats) of the graphs which are presented in analysis of the
simulations. The format is label: description and the label will
appear in the output of the graph.


 * TOTPOP.bysub : time series of the total population, broken down by
   subpopulation type, if there are subpopulations.


 * TOTLPOP.bysub : time series of the log of total population, broken down by
   subpopulation type, if there are subpopulations.

 * TOTPOP.X.bysub : time series of the total population in age class
   X, broken down by subpopulation type.  X will either be denoted by
   an age range (e.g. 0-4) or a numbered age class, beginning with 1.


 * PPOP.X.bysub : time series of the the proportion of the
   subpopulation in age class X, for each subpopulation.  X
   will either be denoted by an age range (e.g. 0-4) or a numbered age
   class, beginning with 1.

 * ASPOP.t.bysub : age structure within each subpopulation at time t
   cycles.

 * GAMMA.t.bysub : age profile of sharing gamma  within each
   subpopulation at time t cycles. 


 * YX.t.bysub : age profile of production  within each
   subpopulation at time t cycles.
